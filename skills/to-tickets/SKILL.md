# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

Read the `## Issue Tracker` section of the project's instructions file (`AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` when there is no `AGENTS.md`), then `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` — together they have the tracker's commands and the triage label vocabulary. If either is missing, stop immediately:

> ⛔ Issue tracker not configured (missing `## Issue Tracker` in the instructions file or `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`).
> Run `/setup-project` before using this skill.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Read `docs/agents/architecture.md` first — module map, test seams, invariants. Ticket titles and descriptions should use its vocabulary, and respect the invariants in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

**One slice is a valid answer.** If the whole spec fits in a single fresh context window, say so and emit one ticket — or tell the user to run `/implement <spec>` directly against the spec, with no tickets at all. `implement` treats a spec without tickets as one unit of work; that is the designed path for small scopes, not a failure. Splitting a spec that already fits buys nothing and costs a full loop per slice.

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges** — the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change — rename a column, retype a shared symbol — whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket — green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct — does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the configured tracker

Publish the approved tickets. **How** depends on the tracker `/setup-project` configured — the tickets are the same either way, only the shape of the blocking edges changes:

- **Local files** → write one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order (blockers first). Each file's "Blocked by" lists the numbers/titles it depends on. Use the per-ticket file template below — one ticket per file, never a single combined file.
- **A real issue tracker (GitHub, Linear, …)** → publish one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the platform's native blocking / sub-issue relationship where it has one; otherwise set each ticket's "Blocked by" to the blocking issues. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label unless instructed otherwise — the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.

  Then **write a working copy of each ticket to `.scratch/<spec-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, and of the spec to `.scratch/<spec-slug>/spec.md` if it isn't there already** — same content, plus the issue number on the first line, in the form `#<N>`, so `implement` can find the file by issue number instead of reconstructing the slug. Use the same `<spec-slug>` `to-spec` used; if the spec folder already exists, write into it. This is not local-mode duplication: `.scratch/` is gitignored and disposable, the issue stays canonical, and if the two ever diverge the issue wins. It exists because `implement` hands the reviewer the *path* to the spec rather than pasting its text, and without the file there is no path to hand. `/setup-project` already declares that both skills write this copy; without this step that declaration is false.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all in `in-review` or closed. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

**Remove `ready-for-agent` from the parent spec.** Once a spec is sliced, it is no longer grabbable — its tickets are. Leaving the label on both makes `gh issue list --label ready-for-agent` return the spec and its tickets flattened into one list with no hierarchy, which is exactly the list `/implement` shows the user when called with no argument; picking the spec from it makes the implementer redo every ticket at once. A board works the same way: nobody picks up an epic, they pick up a story from it. Passing the spec explicitly (`/implement 41`) still works and means "work the frontier".

Apart from that label, do NOT close or modify the parent issue.

<local-ticket-template>

# <NN> — <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

**Blocked by:** the numbers/titles of the tickets that gate this one, or "None — can start immediately".

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1

<issue-template>

## Spec

`#N` — the spec issue this ticket slices, and the section of it this ticket covers. Omit only when there is no parent spec.

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None — can start immediately".

In either form, avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.
